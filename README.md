# molecular-toolkit

The beginnings of a side project. I plan to incorporate simple molecular tools into a 
web application using Streamlit. The goal of this is the following:

- To improve my own coding skills
- To better understand how to organize my code for Streamlit
- Develop easy to use tools for teaching coworkers/classmates/etc
